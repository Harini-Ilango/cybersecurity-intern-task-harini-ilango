## Task Completion 

[✔] Part 1: Threat Model & Attack Surface Analysis 

[✔] Part 2: Deep-Dive Security Analysis 

[✔] Part 3: Incident Response Plan 

## Brief Note 

My overall approach focused on identifying the most critical attack surfaces in ClientHub using STRIDE, OWASP Top 10, and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks, and quantifying their risk with the OWASP Risk Rating and CVSS methodology. I then selected the top-priority risk—OAuth token theft—for deeper analysis, examining technical attack steps, real-world incidents, and effective mitigation strategies. Finally, I outlined a structured incident response plan for a reported IDOR vulnerability, emphasizing immediate containment, investigation, root cause analysis, and verification of fixes.
